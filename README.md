# Cinnotify
Mirrors notifications received on an Android device onto a Linux device with a [libnotify](https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/) compatible notification server installed (e.g. Cinnamon/GNOME).

## TODO
- Implement end to end encryption to prevent interception of potentially private notifications over public networks.
- Send app icon images and display these to tell the user which app the notification came from.
